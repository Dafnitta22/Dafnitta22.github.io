    <h2>Cozumel, Mexico</h2>
    <a><img src="/scoots/images/pexels-pixabay-219998.png" class="tourspic" alt="Beach at Cozumel, Mexico"></a>
    <p>Cozumel Mexico has a culture all its own that has evolved over time. However, in order to really understand the culture of today’s “Cozumeleño” you must first examine its past. The islands native inhabitants are of Mayan descent, and not Mexican, as many still believe. As with all cultures; it is an ever evolving process (from the Latin cultura stemming from colere, meaning "to cultivate") .
    Here is a chronology which will give you some insight into what is Cozumel Mexico today!
    The Mayas (Post-Classic Mayas):
    It gave great significance to urban centers and religious beliefs that are manifest in places likeCozumel Mexico; stone carvings Chichen Itza , Tulum, and San Gervasio (which is located here on Cozumel ). Their stone carvings are also an indication of their advanced and literate culture. A pilgrimage to visit San Gervasio which was the home of the Goddess Ixchel ("She of the Rainbows"), deity of, fertility, midwifery, weaving, and medicine, was a must for every Mayan at least once in their life.
    Now lets advance to modern day Culture:
    During my first visit to Cozumel , when it was still a sleepy little fishing village, I was struck by the genuine friendliness of the people. This culture of sincere friendliness is still pervasive to this day, and is inherited from the culture if its ancestors.
    Of course, as with all cultures that evolve; Cozumel Mexico is now a blend of Mayan, Mexican, Caribbean , as well as influences brought to the island from its over 2 million visitors a year.<a href="http://cozumelmexico.net/Culture/">...Read more</a>

    <p>El Cielo Cozumel, known as "HEAVEN", is one of Cozumel's best kept secrets. It is the most magnificent place in the Caribbean Sea.
    Cozumel's El Cielo is only accessible by boat and is about a mile from Cozumel's Shoreline, and a 25 minute boat ride from the nearest cruise pier.
    El Cielo has shallow crystal clear water as far as the eye can see, which makes it it a perfect place to relax and enjoy the Caribbean Sea. 
    El Cielo Cozumel is covered with soft powdered white sand that massage your feet every step you take. There are lots of starfish located in El Cielo and you'll as find stingrays gliding by only yards from you, also enjoying El Cielo (Stingrays are harmless).
    Our family were the founders of the Snorkel & El Cielo tour which takes you to the best snorkel locations. You start off with a shallow reef to warm up, and then head to Palancar Reef & Columbia Reef and finish up having a delicious lunch and drinks at El Cielo.

    <h2>Baby Sea Turtle Hatching in Cozumel</h2>
    <a><img src="/scoots/images/pexels-jolo-diaz-3661927.png" class="tourspic" alt="Baby Sea Turtle Hatching-Cozumel, Mexico"></a>

    <p>If your looking to experience something different in Cozumel Mexico during your next trip, and visiting from June-November, you may want to check out the Baby Sea Turtle Hatching on the gorgeous Beaches of the Eastern Shore of Cozumel (also known as the other side of Cozumel).
    You may even be able to give a helping hand. We are very lucky to have the opportunity to welcome hundreds of exquisite sea turtles who are in search of the best place to build their nest, and the Eastern Beaches of Cozumel are perfect to host Baby Sea turtles with the help of locals and tourists to guide them to the sea. 
    These two species are known as the Loggerhead Turtle (Caretta Caretta), and the Green Turtle (Chelonia Mydas). They generally lay around 150 eggs, and are able to nest as many as 6 times during one season.
    Approximately 2 months after they lay their eggs, the Baby Sea Turtles emerge to the surface, and typically later in the afternoon, when temperatures are lower. They make their way to the Caribbean Sea, and use the light reflecting from the sea as their guide.
    Those that reach maturity and make it out to the immense ocean may live to age 80 in the wild. Also Cozumel is known to inhabit Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys Imbricate) and the Giant Leatherback Turtles (Thermocouples Coriander) swimming around the reefs of Cozumel Mexico.<a href="http://cozumelcruiseexcursions.net/baby-sea-turtle-hatching-cozumel.html">...Read more</a>
